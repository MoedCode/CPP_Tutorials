this program shold dorow mattrix from a word passed to it like

all args passed
./ternary 5 5 x
xxxxx
xxxxx
xxxxx
xxxxx
xxxxx
just one anumber args passed print square matrix  and  no watermark
so the waer mark will be program name wituout ./
./ternary 5
 ternary ternary ternary ternary ternary
 ternary ternary ternary ternary ternary
 ternary ternary ternary ternary ternary
 ternary ternary ternary ternary ternary
 ternary ternary ternary ternary ternary

 if tow number paased but no watermark
 ./ternary 3 5
 ternary ternary ternary ternary ternary
 ternary ternary ternary ternary ternary
 ternary ternary ternary ternary ternary

# this should be a generic fuctio print arrays so if i call function on array
## numbers arrays
int arr = {1, 2,3};
print_arr("`{%i , }`", arr);
it prints // {1, 2, 3}
print_arr("`%i , `", arr);
it prints // 1, 2, 3
print_arr("`[$]=%i, `", arr);
it prints  // [0]=1, [1]=2, [2]=3
print_arr("`{[$]=%i,} `", arr);
it prints  // {[0]=1, [1]=2, [2]=3 }
sme for double folat
## in  case of string arrays
string names[] = {"username1", "username2", "username3"}
print_arr("`{[$]=%s,} `", arr);
it prints  // {[0]="username1", [1]="username2", [2]="username3" }
and so on ..
it also should  case handle if user print char or normal string
if user not ass format specifir
it should alos handle cstle or  cpp style arrays from all types
```cpp

int print_array(string format , void **arr, size_t size)
{
    int *intptr,  mode ;

    string befIdx, afterIdx ;
    for (int i = 0; format[i]; i++)

            if(format[i] == '`')
            {
                for(size_t j = (i + 1) , k = 0; format[j] !='`'; j++, k++ )
