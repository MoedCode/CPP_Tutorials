he error you're encountering arises from the line:
```cpp
out << (result) ? result : "nullptr";```
n C++, the conditional (ternary) operator `? :` has lower precedence than the insertion operator `<<`. Therefore, the expression is evaluated as:
```cpp
cout << result) ? result : "nullptr";```
ere, `cout << result` is evaluated first, which returns `cout`. Since `cout` is a non-zero value, it is treated as `true`, and thus `result` is selected by the ternary operator. This leads to attempting to print `result` again, which is not the intended behavior.
o fix this issue, you should enclose the conditional expression in parentheses to ensure it is evaluated first:
```cpp
out << (result ? result : "nullptr");```
his ensures that if `result` is not empty, it will be printed; otherwise, "nullptr" will be printed.
dditionally, in your `Fread` function, when the file fails to open, you return `0`, which is implicitly converted to an empty string. A better approach would be to return an empty string explicitly:
```cpp
f (!file.is_open()) {
    cerr << "Error opening file " << file_path << "!\n";
    return "";
}```
his way, when you check `result` in the `main` function, it will correctly identify that the file reading failed.
y making these adjustments, your program should work as intended without encountering the `std::logic_error`.
